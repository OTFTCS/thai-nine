# Thai Course Structure v1 (Immersion Thai with Nine)

## Goal
Create a paid, beginner-friendly Thai course for foreigners that is structured, scalable, and ready to launch in ~8 weeks.

## Current state
- Course direction is clear, but curriculum structure is not finalized.
- Pricing draft exists (not finalized).
- Social channels (TikTok/Instagram) are being built in parallel.
- Production intent: automate script + visuals; keep Nine as human voice/on-camera lead.

## Course architecture (v1)

## Track design
- **Track A: Foundations (A0–A1)** — absolute beginners
- **Track B: Everyday Thai (A1–A2)** — practical conversation & comprehension
- **Track C: Functional Fluency (A2–B1)** — confidence for real-life use

Each track = modules → lessons → quiz + recap.

## Lesson template (standardized)
Each lesson should follow this sequence:
1. **Hook (30–60s)** — what learner can do after this lesson
2. **Core input (5–8 min)** — Nine teaches with examples
3. **Pattern breakdown (3–5 min)** — rules/patterns visualized
4. **Guided practice (3–5 min)** — prompts + pause/respond
5. **Micro-quiz (2–3 min)** — comprehension + recall
6. **Recap + CTA (30–60s)** — what to review next

Target total lesson length: **12–18 minutes**.

---

## Leveling policy
- **Beginner-first language** in explanations.
- Introduce complexity by frequency and utility, not grammar completeness.
- Keep each lesson to 1 primary objective + 1 secondary objective max.

---

## Quiz framework
- **Per-lesson quiz:** 5–8 questions (mix of recognition + production)
- **Per-module quiz:** 15–25 questions + scenario items
- **Spaced review:** repeat weak concepts in next 3 lessons

Question types:
- Audio meaning match
- Thai→English meaning
- English→Thai chunk selection
- Word order arrangement
- Real-world response choice

---

## Content pillars for social (to feed course)
1. Thai mistakes foreigners always make
2. 30-second Thai wins (immediate utility)
3. Pronunciation myth-busting
4. “Thai in real life” mini roleplay
5. Script decoding shortcuts

Each short maps to one lesson/module CTA.

---

## Acceptance criteria for structure lock
- Module map approved (0–8)
- Lesson template fixed
- Quiz format fixed
- First 20 lessons scoped and named
- Social-to-course mapping defined

---

## Risks / unknowns
- Over-scoping full curriculum before MVP lessons are validated
- Too much grammar density early can reduce completion
- Inconsistent script quality if template is not enforced tightly
