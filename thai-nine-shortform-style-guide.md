# Thai Nine Short-Form Style Guide (TikTok / Reels)

## Goal
Create high-retention, <3 minute videos that grow audience and route qualified learners into the paid course funnel.

## Current state
- Channel momentum is built around practical Thai snippets.
- Core strength: one clear concept + approachable teaching voice.

---

## Format rules (non-negotiable)
1. **Length:** 20s–180s max (target 35–90s for most posts)
2. **One concept only:** one word/pattern/topic per video
3. **Hook in 1–2 seconds**
4. **Deliver value by second 10**
5. **End with clear CTA** (save, comment, follow, get full lesson)

---

## Winning short-form formats
1. **“Stop saying X like this” correction format**
2. **“This Thai word has 3 meanings” breakdown**
3. **“In Thailand we actually say…” real-life phrasing**
4. **Quick vocab packs (5 words in one context)**
5. **Pronunciation trap + fix**
6. **Mini roleplay (wrong vs natural version)**

---

## Script skeleton (short-form)
1. Hook line (1 sentence)
2. Concept reveal (1 sentence)
3. 2–4 rapid examples
4. One quick contrast/common mistake
5. Recap line
6. CTA line

Example CTA:
- “Save this for later Thai practice.”
- “Comment the sentence you want me to fix next.”
- “Follow for part 2 / more Thai hacks.”

### Launch-phase rule (important)
- Until the paid course is publicly ready, **do not mention the course in short-form scripts**.
- Use growth CTAs only (follow, save, comment, share).

---

## On-screen visual rules
- Big Thai text + transliteration + concise meaning
- Max 1–2 lines on screen at once
- Use color coding (Thai / pronunciation / meaning)
- Keep transitions quick but clean (no clutter)

---

## Audio & delivery
- Energetic but natural pace
- Emphasize mouth shape/pronunciation for key words
- Use repetition intentionally (2x max for key phrase)

---

## Content mix target (weekly)
- 40% grammar/pattern hacks
- 30% practical survival phrases
- 20% pronunciation / listening traps
- 10% trend-reactive/seasonal content

---

## KPI targets
- 3-second hold rate
- Average watch time
- Completion rate
- Saves + shares
- Profile visits and CTR to bio/course

---

## Not for short-form
- Deep grammar lectures
- Long story intros
- Overloaded vocabulary lists without context
- Full lesson-style pacing

---

## Risks / unknowns
- Overusing one format can fatigue audience
- Trend chasing can dilute brand if not tied to Thai learning value
