# Thai Nine Course Style Guide (Paid, In-Depth)

## Goal
Deliver premium, structured Thai learning lessons that justify payment through depth, clarity, practice, and downloadable notes.

## Current state
- Audience attraction happens via short-form.
- Course must feel clearly different: slower, deeper, more complete.

---

## Course lesson promise
Every lesson must provide:
1. A clear learning objective
2. Structured explanation
3. Guided practice
4. Review/quiz
5. Downloadable PDF notes

---

## Lesson format (10–20 minutes)
1. **Objective + roadmap** (30–60s)
2. **Core teaching** (4–7 min)
3. **Worked examples** (3–5 min)
4. **Guided drills** (2–4 min)
5. **Common mistakes + fixes** (1–2 min)
6. **Review + mini quiz prompt** (1–2 min)
7. **Next lesson bridge** (30s)

---

## Content depth requirements
- Explain not just “what,” but “when and why”
- Include at least 2 context variants per key phrase
- Include formal/informal note when relevant
- Include pronunciation caution if likely confusion exists

---

## PDF notes requirements
Each lesson PDF should include:
- Lesson objective
- Key vocabulary table
- Core patterns/structures
- Example sentences with translation
- Common mistakes section
- Practice prompts + answer key (or separate key)

---

## Quiz style
- 5–10 questions per lesson
- Mix: recognition + production + context choice
- Add one “real-life scenario” question minimum

---

## Visual style (Remotion side)
- Calm, readable pacing
- Information hierarchy first (not flashy edits)
- Persistent module/lesson indicator
- Key terms repeatedly surfaced for retention

---

## Voice style (Nine on-camera)
- Supportive and clear, not rushed
- Encourage repeat-after-me moments
- Explain common learner confusion empathetically

---

## Distinction from short-form (hard boundary)
Course videos are NOT:
- trend-driven snippets
- hook-only content
- speed-run explanations

Course videos ARE:
- sequenced curriculum assets
- cumulative and review-oriented
- worksheet/quiz integrated

---

## Quality gates before publish
- Language correctness check
- Pedagogy check (one main objective achieved)
- PDF quality check
- Quiz check
- A/V check

---

## Risks / unknowns
- If pacing is too fast, learners won’t retain
- If too slow, completion drops
- Need regular learner feedback to tune depth vs speed
