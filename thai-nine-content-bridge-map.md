# Thai Nine Content Bridge Map (Short-Form -> Course)

## Goal
Use short-form content to attract learners and systematically move them into course lessons with clear relevance.

## Current state
- Strong short-form potential exists.
- Need a deliberate bridge from “viral clip” to “paid lesson progression.”

---

## Bridge model
Each course lesson should produce:
- **1 core lesson video** (paid)
- **2–3 short clips** (free)
- **1 PDF/quiz anchor** (paid value proof)

Shorts should tease the pain point + quick win.
Course should deliver complete mastery + practice.

## Mapping template

| Course Lesson | Short Clip A (Hook) | Short Clip B (Mistake Fix) | Short Clip C (Scenario) | CTA |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| L01: Thai sound basics | “3 sounds foreigners miss” | “Why this tone sounds wrong” | “Can you hear the difference?” | “Full beginner lesson + notes in course” |
| L02: Intro phrases | “Say your name naturally in Thai” | “Don’t translate this literally” | “Thai self-intro in 20 seconds” | “Get full intro script in lesson 2” |
| L03: Useful particles | “This tiny word changes tone” | “ครับ/ค่ะ common misuse” | “Polite vs casual mini roleplay” | “Practice sheet in course module 1” |

(Use this pattern for all 20 lessons.)

## CTA ladder
1. Video CTA: save/comment/follow
2. Profile CTA: “Start Thai from zero — full course + worksheets”
3. Landing CTA: module preview + outcomes + purchase
4. Post-purchase CTA: start Lesson 1 + take quiz

## Conversion assets checklist
- Bio link with clear course promise
- Landing page with sample lesson clip
- 1 free downloadable sample PDF
- Testimonials/social proof over time
- FAQ: who it’s for, expected timeline, refund policy

---

## Weekly execution rhythm
- Publish 4–6 short clips/week
- Release 1–2 course lessons/week
- Match short topics to latest course lesson
- Review analytics weekly and adjust topic mix

---

## Metrics to watch
- Short-form saves/shares
- Profile click-through rate
- Landing conversion rate
- Lesson 1 completion rate
- Week 1 learner retention

---

## Not now
- Building too many channels at once
- Long-form YouTube expansion before funnel is stable
- Advanced automation before content quality baseline is reliable

---

## Risks / unknowns
- Weak CTA alignment can create views but low conversion
- If shorts overpromise and course under-delivers, trust drops
- Need tight topic planning so both engines reinforce each other
