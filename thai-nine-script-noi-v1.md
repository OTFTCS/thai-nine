# TikTok Script — หน่อย (noi)

**Creator:** Nine (@thaiwith.nine)
**Format:** Talking head, one-take friendly
**Target length:** 50–65 seconds
**Topic:** The word หน่อย — how Thai people actually use it to soften requests

---

## Pronunciation Note for Nine

หน่อย = **nòi** (low tone, rhymes with "boy" but with a shorter, softer ending — lips slightly rounded). Avoid saying it like "noy" with a flat tone. The low tone dip is what makes it sound natural.

## Script

### [0:00–0:02] HOOK

**Nine says:**
"If you sound rude in Thai… it's probably because you're missing THIS word."

**On-screen text:**
> 🚨 You sound rude without this word

---

### [0:03–0:08] CONCEPT REVEAL

**Nine says:**
"The word is หน่อย — nòi. Thai people put it at the end of a sentence to make anything sound softer and more polite. Think of it like adding 'please' — but more natural."

**On-screen text:**
> **หน่อย**
> nòi
> "softener / a little / please"

---

### [0:09–0:16] EXAMPLE 1

**Nine says:**
"Instead of just saying ขอน้ำ — give me water — say ขอน้ำหน่อย. Hear the difference? Way softer."

**On-screen text:**
> ❌ ขอน้ำ — kǎw náam — "Give me water" (blunt)
> ✅ ขอน้ำหน่อย — kǎw náam nòi — "Can I get some water?" (soft)

---

### [0:17–0:25] EXAMPLE 2

**Nine says:**
"At a restaurant — you want the bill. Say เก็บเงินหน่อย — gèp ngern nòi. Simple, polite, very Thai."

**On-screen text:**
> **เก็บเงินหน่อย**
> gèp ngern nòi
> "Check, please"

---

### [0:26–0:34] EXAMPLE 3

**Nine says:**
"Or asking someone to wait — รอแป๊บหน่อย — raw bpáep nòi. You'll hear this one everywhere in Thailand."

**On-screen text:**
> **รอแป๊บหน่อย**
> raw bpáep nòi
> "Wait a moment"

---

### [0:35–0:44] COMMON MISTAKE

**Nine says:**
"Now here's a mistake I hear all the time. Don't put หน่อย at the beginning of a sentence. It always goes at the END. And don't confuse it with น้อย — nóoi — which means 'a small amount.' Different tone, different meaning."

**On-screen text:**
> ⚠️ Common mistake
> หน่อย (nòi) = softener → END of sentence
> น้อย (nóoi) = "a little / few" → different word!

### [0:45–0:52] RECAP + CTA

**Nine says:**
"หน่อย — one tiny word, but it changes how Thai people hear you. If you want to learn the full system behind polite Thai — particles, tone, when to use what — I break it all down step by step in my course. Link's in my bio."

## Filming Notes

- **Framing:** Medium close-up, natural background (home/cafe)
- **Energy:** Start strong on the hook, warm and conversational for examples, slightly slower on the mistake section for clarity
- **Hand gestures:** Point or gesture when contrasting ❌ vs ✅ examples
- **Repeat key word:** Say หน่อย clearly at least 4–5 times throughout so viewers absorb the pronunciation
- **One-take friendly:** Script flows linearly — no cuts required, but a jump cut after the hook can add punch if desired
