# M01-L001 — Survival Thai 01: First 10 Minutes in Thailand

- **Season:** Survival Thai (Module 1)
- **Level:** A0 → Early A1
- **Target runtime:** 8–12 minutes (minimum 5 minutes)
- **Primary objective:** Learner can handle first-contact interactions politely in Thai.
- **Secondary objective:** Learner can produce clear survival lines with correct politeness particles and usable tone-marked transliteration.
- **Scenario:** Arrival day in Thailand (hotel, café, taxi, convenience store).

## Lesson outcomes (must-do)
By the end, learner can say and understand:
1. **Greeting:** `สวัสดี` | `sà-wàt-dii` | hello
2. **Thank you:** `ขอบคุณ` | `khàawp-khun` | thank you
3. **Polite endings:** `ครับ/ค่ะ` | `khráp/khâ` | polite sentence endings
4. **Excuse me / sorry:** `ขอโทษ` | `khǎaw-thôot` | excuse me / sorry
5. **I don't understand:** `ไม่เข้าใจ` | `mâi khâo-jai` | I don’t understand
6. **Can you speak slowly?:** `พูดช้าๆ ได้ไหม` | `phûut cháa-cháa dâai mái` | can you speak slowly?

## Core vocab (triplet format)
| Thai | Transliteration | English |
|---|---|---|
| สวัสดี | sà-wàt-dii | hello |
| ขอบคุณ | khàawp-khun | thank you |
| ครับ | khráp | polite particle (male speaker) |
| ค่ะ | khâ | polite particle (female statement) |
| คะ | khá | polite particle (female question) |
| ขอโทษ | khǎaw-thôot | excuse me / sorry |
| ไม่เข้าใจ | mâi khâo-jai | I don’t understand |
| พูดช้าๆ ได้ไหม | phûut cháa-cháa dâai mái | can you speak slowly? |

## Teaching constraints
- Keep this practical, not academic.
- Every Thai line shown with transliteration + English.
- Transliteration must follow PTM-adapted scheme with inline tone marks (no superscript tone letters).
- Include repetition drills and micro role-plays.

## Common mistakes to catch in QA
1. Using `ค่ะ` and `คะ` interchangeably.
2. Dropping politeness particles in formal first-contact situations.
3. Saying `khop-khun` without low tone marker (must be `khàawp-khun` in this system).
4. Speaking too fast during drills (must include deliberate slow model).
