# Spoken Script — M01-L001

## Hook
If Thai has ever felt intimidating, this lesson will make it simple. Today you'll understand *why* Thai sounds different and how to start correctly from day one.

## Core input
[SCREEN: Thai is a tone language]
In Thai, tone changes meaning. Same consonants, different tone, different word.
[THAI: ข้าว] rice.
[THAI: ข่าว] news.
Notice the vowel is similar, but tone and context matter.

Thai script is alphabetic, not pictographic. You build words from consonants + vowels + tone behavior.

Politeness particles are essential:
- [THAI: ครับ] for male speakers.
- [THAI: ค่ะ] for female statements.
- [THAI: คะ] for female questions.

## Pattern breakdown
Three truths to remember:
1. Tone carries meaning.
2. Thai verbs do not conjugate like English.
3. Respect and softness often live at the end of a sentence.

## Guided practice
Now you try.
Say hello politely as a male speaker.
[PAUSE 3s]
Correct: [THAI: สวัสดีครับ]

Say thank you politely as a female speaker.
[PAUSE 3s]
Correct: [THAI: ขอบคุณค่ะ]
