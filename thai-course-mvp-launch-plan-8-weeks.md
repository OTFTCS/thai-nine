# Thai Course MVP Launch Plan (8 Weeks)

## Goal
Launch a paid MVP Thai course with strong beginner value, stable production workflow, and social-driven demand.

## Current state
- Product concept validated internally
- Structure and pipeline now defined at draft level
- Need execution focus + strict scope control

---

## MVP scope (must-ship)
- **20 core lessons** (Foundations + Survival + Sentence basics)
- **20 lesson quizzes**
- **Simple course landing page + checkout flow**
- **Social funnel:** TikTok/Instagram posts tied to lesson CTAs
- **Weekly learner feedback loop**

Not in MVP:
- Full advanced curriculum
- Huge content library
- Complex app/platform features

---

---

## Weekly operating plan (time-aware)
If limited time each week, prioritize:
1. Lesson production (core)
2. QA (must not skip)
3. Social clips linked to produced lessons
4. Funnel/landing improvements

---

## KPIs for MVP success
- Landing → purchase conversion
- Lesson 1 completion rate
- Week 1 retention (lessons 1–3 complete)
- Quiz completion rate
- Social CTR to landing
- Refund rate / satisfaction feedback

---

## Suggested next PR/work items
1. `docs: add course structure v1 + lesson templates`
2. `feat: add lesson metadata schema + quiz schema`
3. `feat: add remotion lesson scene template (split-screen)`
4. `ops: add production checklist and release checklist`

---

## Not now (scope control)
- Full app platform build before course traction
- 50+ lessons before validating paid demand
- Multi-language subtitles/localizations in MVP
- Heavy automation before template stability

---

## Risks / unknowns
- Overbuilding curriculum before testing learner behavior
- Inconsistent quality if production pace outruns QA
- Social growth may lag without strong hooks and CTA discipline
