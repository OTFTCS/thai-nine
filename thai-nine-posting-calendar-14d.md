# @thaiwith.nine — 14-Day TikTok Posting Calendar

Target: 1 post/day for 14 days (beginner to lower-intermediate audience).
All videos <3 min; most 35–90 s. Follow the short-form style guide — one concept, hook by second 2, value by second 10.

---

## Content Mix Rules

1. **40/30/20/10 weekly split** — Grammar & pattern hacks (40%), survival phrases (30%), pronunciation & listening traps (20%), trend-reactive or culture bites (10%). Never post the same category two days in a row.
2. **Alternate effort levels** — No two High-effort days back-to-back. Schedule at least 2 Low-effort "quick win" posts per week to stay consistent without burnout.
3. **Bridge before sell** — Every video must deliver a standalone win. The course bridge is a natural extension, never the main point. Ratio: ~3 pure-value posts for every 1 post with a direct course CTA.

## Metrics to Track Daily

1. **3-second hold rate** — Did the hook work? Target: >70%.
2. **Average watch time / completion rate** — Is the teaching tight enough? Target: >50% completion.
3. **Saves + shares** — Signals long-term value; strongest predictor of reach on TikTok.

## Weekly Review Ritual (every Sunday evening)

Pull the week's numbers into a simple table: views, 3-sec hold rate, avg watch time, saves, shares, profile visits, bio-link clicks. Identify the top-performing post and the bottom-performing post. Ask:

- **Top post:** What format, hook style, and topic drove it? Can I make a Part 2 or a related spin-off?
- **Bottom post:** Was it the hook, the topic, or the pacing? One concrete fix for next week.
- **Funnel check:** Did profile visits and bio-link clicks trend up or down vs last week?

Write one sentence: "Next week I will do more of ___ and less of ___." Pin it where you plan content.

## Notes

- Days are numbered D1–D14 so the calendar is date-agnostic. Slot them into any starting Monday.
- Effort level reflects filming + editing load: **Low** = talking head + text overlay, **Med** = planned examples + on-screen graphics, **High** = multi-scene or roleplay edit.
- Reuse top performers: if a video breaks out, schedule a Part 2 or "reply to comments" follow-up within 3 days while momentum is live.
